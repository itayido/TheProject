    <h1>Number Memory Testâ€“ Instructions</h1>
    <p>
      Test how many numbers you can remember and recall correctly. Each round, a
      number will appear <br />
      on the screen for a few seconds. Your goal is to memorize it and type it
      correctly after it disappears.
    </p>
    <h2>How to play:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start the game.</strong><br />Press the "Start" or "Play" button
        to begin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Memorize the number.</strong><br />A number will appear on the
        screen for a short time (e.g., 3 seconds). Try to memorize it carefully.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Number disappears.</strong><br />The number will vanish, and
        you'll be asked to click it from memory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Check your number.</strong><br />If you're wrong, the game ends,
        and you'll see your score (the highest level you reached).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>ðŸ’¡ Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Focus and try to remember the number in chunks (e.g., 471-238 instead of
        471238).
      </li>
      <li>Stay calm â€” the numbers get longer gradually.</li>
      <li>Challenge yourself to beat your previous high score!</li>
    </ul>
