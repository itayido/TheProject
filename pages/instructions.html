      <h1>Number Memory Testâ€“ Instructions</h1>
      <p>
        Test how many numbers you can remember and recall correctly. Each round,
        a number will appear <br />
        on the screen for a few seconds. Your goal is to memorize it and type it
        correctly after it disappears.
      </p>
      <h2>How to play:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Start the game.</strong><br />Press the "Start" or "Play"
          button to begin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memorize the number.</strong><br />A number will appear on the
          screen for a short time (e.g., 3 seconds). Try to memorize it
          carefully.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Number disappears.</strong><br />The number will vanish, and
          you'll be asked to click it from memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check your number.</strong><br />If you're wrong, the game
          ends, and you'll see your score (the highest level you reached).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>ðŸ’¡ Tips:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus and try to remember the number in chunks.</li>
        <li>Stay calm â€” the numbers get longer gradually.</li>
        <li>Challenge yourself to beat your previous high score!</li>
      </ul>
